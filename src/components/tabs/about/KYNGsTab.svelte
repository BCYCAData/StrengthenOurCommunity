			Our community led project, by supporting 'old principles' with technology (digital mapping),

			ensures our community will be prepared for future challenges, more connected, and empowered to

		<h3>WHAT ARE KYNGS? - Know Your Neighbour Groups</h3>
		<p class="my-2">
			KYNGs are smaller groups within the community and live on adjoining roads. These groups focus
			on connections and strengthening two-way communication lines. In an emergency, messages to
			KYNG co-ordinators can be shared with their group and critical information shared with
			emergency services.
		</p>
		<p class="my-2">
			KYNG Co-ordinators will initially gather and share information, create connections and
			relationships. Who knows where else this can go?
		</p>
		<p class="my-2">
			One size doesn’t suit all, so we will provide a very simple structure and allow the group
			itself to decide on the best methods of sharing information for them.

				Explain what KYNGs are and why they are important - sharing information (two-way flow),
